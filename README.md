Community Multiscale Air Quality Model [US EPA Website](https://www.epa.gov/air-research/community-multi-scale-air-quality-cmaq-modeling-system-air-quality-management)

CMAQ is an active open-source development project of the U.S. EPA Computational Exposure Division
that consists of a suite of programs for conducting air quality model simulations.
CMAQ is supported by the CMAS Center (http://www.cmascenter.org).

CMAQ combines current knowledge in atmospheric science and air quality modeling with multi-processor
computing techniques in an open-source framework to deliver fast, technically sound estimates of ozone,
particulates, toxics, and acid deposition.

This CMAQ Git archive is organized with each official public release stored as a branch on the main USEPA/CMAQ repository.
To clone code from the CMAQ Git archive, specify the branch (i.e. version number) and issue the following command from within
a working directory on your server:

git clone -b CMAQ_v5.2 https://github.com/USEPA/CMAQ.git

This command shows how to check out CMAQ v5.2 codes and scripts.  

[CMAQv5.2 Documentation](docs/User_Manual/User_Manual.md)   
[CMAQv5.2 Release Notes](docs/Release_Notes/Summary.md)   
Release notes and Code documentation are included within this repository (they are version-controlled along with the code itself).

Benchmark/tutorial input and output data for each CMAQ release version are available from the CMAS Center Software Clearinghouse. From http://www.cmascenter.org, select Download -> Software -> CMAQ and choose the version to get the tutorial data.
