CMAQ
====

Community Multiscale Air Quality Model (http://www.cmaq-model.org)

CMAQ is an active open-source development project of the U.S. EPA Atmospheric Science Modeling Division
that consists of a suite of programs for conducting air quality model simulations.
CMAQ is supported and distributed by the CMAS Center (http://www.cmascenter.org).

CMAQ combines current knowledge in atmospheric science and air quality modeling with multi-processor
computing techniques in an open-source framework to deliver fast, technically sound estimates of ozone,
particulates, toxics, and acid deposition.

The CMAQ Git archive is organized with each official public release stored as a branch on the main CMASCenter/CMAQ repository.
To check out code from the CMAQ Git archive, specify the branch (i.e. version number) and issue the following command from within
a working directory on your server:

git clone -b 5.1 https://github.com/CMASCenter/CMAQ.git

This command shows how to check out CMAQ v5.1 codes and scripts.  

The release versions of CMAQ that are currently available on Git Hub include:

* [v5.1 (December 2015)](https://github.com/CMASCenter/CMAQ/tree/5.1)
* v5.0.2 (April 2014)
* v5.0.1 (July 2012)
