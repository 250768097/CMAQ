To create a new CSQY_DATA table for the mechanism:

1) Modify the build/run script
for the compiler and its flags on your computer platform.

2) Change the build/run script for your application. If application uses 
photolysis rates whose cross-section and quantum yields are not listed 
under photolysis_CSQY_data, create the data files and add them to the directory.
 
4) Execute the script. Inputs and reference output are provided for the
cb05e51_ae6_aq mechanism in CMAQ version 5.1.

To report program errors or failures, contact Bill Hutzell/USEPA at 
hutzell.bill@epa.gov.
