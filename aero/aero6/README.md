CMAQv5.2 Aerosol Processing Module (Aero6)
==========================================

Aerosol calculations the CMAQ aero6 module account for several relevant microphysical processes: emission, condensation, evaporation, coagulation, new particle formation, and chemistry. The size distribution of particles is conceptualized in this module as the sum of three log-normal modes: Aitken, Accumulation and Coarse. The magnitude and shape of these modes are predicted in time by tracking the magnitude of three moments: 0th (equivalent to number), 2nd (proportional to surface area) and 3rd (proportional to volume or mass).
