CMAQ Release Notes Guidance
===========================

[Release Notes for CMAQv5.2](Summary.md)

In this folder we keep all of the individual descriptions of updates to the current version of CMAQ. In general, there should be an approximate 1:1 correspondence between updates and accepted, merged Pull Requests. This is not completely accurate since it is very possible to have one update spread across a few Pull Requests or to have one Pull Request address two or more updates. However, the rule is a good starting point.  

The title of each note file is up to the user (please make it close to the title of the update), but every file should have a '.md' extension. We encourage developers to conform each note to the following template when possible (if the author desires an alternative format, go for it):

-----
