! Emissions Scaling Specification Section                                      !
!   Each rule is presented as a row of inputs. The syntax of the               !
!   emissions scaling rules is the following:                                  !
!      EM_INSTR(I) = 'CMAQ-Species', 'Source Label', 'Phase',                  !
!                     'Surrogate', 'Scale Factor', 'Mask', 'Operation'         !
!   Definition of Fields:                                                      !
!         'Surrogate' - The character string identifying the surrogate on the  !
!                       emission file or in the inline calculation that the    !
!                       CMAQ species should be mapped to. Usually this name is !
!                       the same as the CMAQ species for convenience. For      !
!                       aerosols, it's usually slightly different (e.g ANO3 vs.!
!                       PNO3)                                                  !
!         'Source Label' - Short Name from Run Script (ie. the value of        !
!                          GR_EMIS_01_LAB or STK_EMIS_01_LAB). There are a few !
!                          reserved names that apply to inline emissions       !
!                          sources. These are:                                 !
!                            BIOG - Biogenic VOC emissions                     !
!                            MGEM - Marine Gas Emissions                       !
!                            LTNG - Lightning NO Emissions                     !
!                            WBDUST - Wind-Blown Dust Emissions                !
!                            SeaSpray - Sea Spray Aerosol Emissions            !
!         'CMAQ-Species' - Internal Species Name                               !
!         'Phase/Mode'- If the CMAQ-Species is a Gas, this field should equal  !
!                       'Gas'. If the CMAQ-Species is an aerosol, this field   !
!                       should indicate one of the possible emission aerosol   !
!                       modes. Every source by default is given a 'COARSE' and !
!                       'FINE' mode. The user may refer to these, or define    !
!                       others above and refer to them as well. This level of  !
!                       speficity is needed so that aerosol number and         !
!                       surface area are calculated correctly, and so that any !
!                       unit conversions between gases and aerosols can be     !
!                       handled correctly.                                     !
!         'Scale Factor' - Adjustment factor to be applied to the mapping      !
!         'Mask'         - Not implemented yet. Will apply scaling for specific! 
!                          regions of the domain.                              !
!         'Operation' - Specifies what kind of rule is to be carried           !
!                       out. Options are:                                      !
!                          'a' - add the rule to existing instructions. This   !
!                                operation should be used for new entries, too.!
!                          'm' - find existing scaling instructions matching   !
!                                this rule's features (ie. species, sources,   !
!                                etc) and multiply them by the factor in this  !
!                                particular rule.                              !
!                          'o' - find existing scaling instrucitons matching   !
!                                this rule and overwrite them.                 !
!                                                                              !

! Region-Based Scaling Specification Section                                   !
!   It is possible in CMAQ to scale emissions for a subset of the model domain !
!   using gridded masks to indicate where the scaling should occur. These masks!
!   should be of type real and provided as variables on a file with format     !
!   consistent with IO-API. Any number of files and variables may be used to   !
!   specify 1 or more "regions" to be used in CMAQ. This section of the name-  !
!   list provides users with an interface to name these regions and identify   !
!   the source data for each.
!                                                                              !
!   Definition of Fields:                                                      !
!      'Region  - Label for the region that is being specified. By default, the!
!        Label'   first region, which will never be specified here, is the     !
!                 whole domain, or "EVERYWHERE". It is included in this file   !
!                 for transparency but should always be commented out.         !
!      'File  - With this label, the user identifies the file that the data for!
!       Label'  this region is stored on. The CMAQ runscript should provide the!
!               path to this file using the environment variable construct. For!
!               example, to refer to file "CMAQ_REGIONS" with path             !
!               "/home/user/data/cmaq/cmaq_region_file.nc" the specification in!
!               the CMAQ runscript would look like:                            !
!                  SETENV CMAQ_REGIONS /home/user/data/cmaq/cmaq_region_file.nc!
!               Note that an unlimited number of files can be used here, but   !
!               each must contain a path for reference in the runscript.       !
!      'Variable  - This label identifies the variable on the region file that !
!        on File'   should be used to populate this particular region. Each    !
!                   variable should be of type real and have dimensions equal  !
!                   to the size of the CMAQ domain. In this way, the fraction  !
!                   of every region should be available for every model grid   !
!                   cell.
