|  The Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) system software is in contin-   |
|  uous development by various groups and is based on information from these   |
|  groups: Federal Government employees, contractors working within a United   |
|  States Government contract, and non-Federal sources including research      |
|  institutions.  These groups give the Government permission to use, prepare  |
|  derivative works of, and distribute copies of their work in the CMAQ system |
|  to the public and to permit others to do so.  The United States Environ-    |
|  mental Protection Agency therefore grants similar permission to use the     |
|  CMAQ system software, but users are requested to provide copies of deriva-  |
|  tive works or products designed to operate in the CMAQ system to the United |
|  States Government without restrictions as to use by others.  Software that  |
|  is used with the CMAQ system but distributed under the GNU General Public   |
|  License or the GNU Lesser General Public License is subject to their copy-  |
|  right restrictions.                                                         |
